# What I'm doing now

### Helping people develop awareness to make new choices

I am founder, and Counsellor, at [[Talk. Art. Therapy.]] where I help people to etc. Some notes on my Counselling approach:
- [[From states to traits]]

## Previously: 
Before this I was working as a photographer via my name-in-kind business [[Max Milne Photography]]. Where I undertook a diverse range of projects: fine art, advertising, editorial and more. Wanting my own studio I founded [[Studio Brunswick]], and over five years built three stand alone Photographic Studios for hire. Yes, in Brunswick.

At different times I've:
- Toured as a Performance Artist - [[The SBSB]], [[VOICE]] and [[NGV show]].
- Showed as a fine Art Photographer - [[Ritus]], [[MeWe]] etc
- Curatored - [[Studio Brunswick - Exhibitions]], [[Archie]]
- Lived in Buddhist Monasteries -  [[Time in Monastary]]
- Taught Meditation - [[MBC - Young People]], [[The Sit Spot]], [[Interbeing]] and [[Social Meditation Collective]].
- Hosted workshops - [[AI for YourEyes]], [[Porns place in etc]]

And been an old round [[Art Nerd]].

Want even more? My [[cv]] hosts too much detail.
