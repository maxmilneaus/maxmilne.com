Maybe being a photographer was destined for me. Born of the hours I sat waiting in a room filled with a red dim glow, and listened to the sound of lightly slushing water as my mother gently gripped pieces of paper and silver acetate with squeaky tongues and slide them into the air to have them caught by the light click of a wooden peg, to drip, and reveal a B&W image of the side of my sisters face.

The dark room was a sanctuary for her. For me it was a door in the art room at my primary school that no one used. And I was there, on school holidays. The bonus? I could sneak into my teachers room and eat straight from her lolly jar. 

-------

Ten years on (2008), with the chemicals of the dark room driving me subconsciously, I decided to founded my first business - Max Milne Photography. I moved to Sydney and assisted the likes of [Gary Heery](https://www.garyheery.com/#the-book), [Juliet Taylor](https://www.juliettaylor.com/about), [Julian Wolkenstein](https://www.julianwolkenstein.com/photography) and many others. Then moved back to Melbourne to start in ernest my own career, working with many brands, companies, projects and people that I admire. 
 
From 2015-2020 I started building Photography Studios for [[Studio Brunswick]] and hiring them out to others for use. 

Along the way I worked for a bunch of clients: Sydney Festival, Interview Magazine, Bendigo Bank, Melbourne University, Telstra, RACV, Qantas, TAC and Vogue and was represented by Getty as a stock photographer. That saw my photos end up in many strange places.

I had the luck of picking up a couple of awards along the way and working with so many different teams around Australia. Co-winner Faces of Sydney Festival Competition (2017) and Head On Portrait Prize (2012). Winner of the BSG National Photographic Prize (2011).
