As the duo [Transmit Recieve](https://transmitreceive.tumblr.com) sound designer [Adam Hunt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-hunt/) and I were selected to present a piece of work from our performance art work, [[VOICE]], on the nascent ABC podcast – Long Story Short – Australia’s version of “This American Life”. 

Listen here:

The piece was a trimmed 5 minute narrative driven component of the work that was performed in one take by the delightful [Penny Harpham.](https://pennyharpham.wordpress.com/)
Where she recounts a visceral retelling on a time she found someone in a crashed car alongside a highway road in country Australia. It is incredible piece that Adam so skilfully edited and crafted sound wise.

Here is a link to the original show on the ABC website here: [LINK](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/radionational/archived/longstoryshort/breath/4574480)
