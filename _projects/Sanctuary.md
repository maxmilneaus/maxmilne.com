> *“We believe that big and old trees always have the spirit, we respect them and ask for protection.”* Pongjit Saphakhun

A short film about finding home in a new country through a big old elm tree on Merri Creek.

I was invited to come on board to create a film with The Echoes project (Ria Soemardjo, Janette Hoe and Jon (Pongjit Saphakhun) and Ron Reeves.) for Mapping Melbourne 2020. 

The piece was recorded across two hours on a lazy afternoon alongside the Merri Creek in Coburg, Melbourne. ‘Sanctuary’ is about creating a contemporary performance ritual centered around an old tree next to the Merri Creek, that reminds Jon of a tree from where she grew up in Thailand. 
Exploring our urge to connect more deeply with nature and our local green spaces, by creating contemporary performance work that transforms our relationship to urban sites.

Collaboration with: [Ria Soemardjo](https://www.riavoice.com), [Ron Reeves](https://www.facebook.com/ronreevesmusic/) and [Pongjit Saphakhun.]([https://www.freetheatre.com.au/team]())
