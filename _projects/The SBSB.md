A playful and evocative work of live art along and across a river.

See the world from four new perspectives – The Stream / The Boat / The Shore / The Bridge – and add your thoughts, voice and hands to the action of a live public artwork.

Four participants each experience a series of interconnected site-specific performances along and across a river. At each of the four locations you are drawn into the performance at both a physical and emotional level, as you interact directly with an artist in a responsive one-on-one performance.

A playful and evocative work, The Stream / The Boat / The Shore / The Bridge stimulates conversation and places participants at the centre of the action.
