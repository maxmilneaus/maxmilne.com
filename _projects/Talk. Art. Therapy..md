Fifteen years of helping people tell visual stories at [[Max Milne Photography]] taught me to notice what lives in the frame and what breathes just outside it. The gesture caught between moments. The story waiting in the shadows.

Now I help people tell a different kind of story — the ones they carry inside about who they are, what happened, and what matters. Not stories to sell or perform, but stories to live by.

As a counsellor, I work with people as they make sense of one thread at a time. Sometimes that's a compulsive pattern that once kept them safe but now stands between them and what they want. Sometimes it's historical complexity asking to be attended to. Sometimes it's learning to say no to one thing so they can say a deeper yes to what actually matters.

I'm not here with answers. I'm a witness and companion to the process — offering tools, holding steady while they choose the stitch. Asking questions that help them find their own way through the territory they're traveling.
