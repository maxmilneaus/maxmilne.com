This horizontal scroll format feels right for photo essays - it creates a deliberate, contemplative pace. You're not just consuming images; you're moving through them, making choices about when to pause and when to continue.

The film strip metaphor connects to the materiality of photography itself - each frame distinct, but part of a larger sequence.
YEs TEST.
