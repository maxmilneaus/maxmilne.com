# What I'm doing now
#### Starting [[Talk. Art. Therapy.]]:

I've just finished my Masters in Counselling and now I'm in the building phase of establishing a private practice — setting up workflows, designing this website, organising practice spaces.
#### Hosting Social Meditation:

Four mornings a week, I host online meditation sessions through Social Meditation Collective (evolved from what was Interbe.ing). We've been meeting for about ten months now. I'm planning to bring these practices in-person soon, with a focus on building skills through relational practice.

The format is simple: people practice together, speaking their experience aloud. It builds awareness through the social engagement system — something between solo meditation and group therapy with the life story.
#### Exploring AI and Privacy:

I'm deep in the technical weeds of large language models, thinking about how to build secure, on-device AI systems for psychologists. Privacy matters in therapeutic work, and current cloud-based tools don't cut it.

Learning to code as I go — making small, malleable apps. Reading [Ethan Mollick](https://www.oneusefulthing.org) and [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net). Experimenting with Claude Code and local LLMs.

#### Making Resources:

Building a grief zine for clients — prompts for writing to the lost one, planting seeds in their memory, that kind of thing. Tangible tools people can hold and work with.

#### Other Threads:

Dancing regularly (Contact Improvisation, 5Rhythms) as my integrative practice. Rediscovered my old MP3 library and I'm listening album by album — more intentional than streaming's endless random scroll.
