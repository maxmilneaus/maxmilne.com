excerpt: "Exploring relational meditation practices that bridge solo mindfulness and group therapeutic work, combining traditional Buddhist noting with interpersonal neurobiology."

**Interbe.ing ended up folding and now the key practioners of that and I are running building on these practices together via the Social Meditation Collective**

Recently, I’ve been deep diving into a relational meditation practice system called [Interbe.ing](https://interbe.ing/), which represents an innovative intersection between traditional mindfulness and collective expression. As both a practitioner and clinical psychologist, I’m particularly intrigued by how this practice bridges the gap between solo meditation and group therapeutic interventions.

## Theoretical Framework: The Science of Relational Practice

Interbe.ing emerges from a rich theoretical foundation, blending traditional Burmese Theravada practices with contemporary understanding of interpersonal neurobiology. The practice’s lineage traces from the Mental Noting techniques of Ledi and Mahasi Sayadaw, through Kenneth Folk’s externalized noting, to its current incarnation as a gamified social practice developed by Vincent Horn and Chris Ewald.

Within the framework of Siegel’s interpersonal neurobiology, these practices operate at the intersection of neural integration and interpersonal attunement. The externalisation of internal states – through verbal “noting” – activates what Porges terms the “social engagement system,” facilitating both intrapersonal awareness and interpersonal connection. It’s part of an emerging family of practices that bring meditation out of solitude and into relationship with others.

## Interbe.ing in particular:

### Core Structure

Interbe.ing sessions typically involve four participants meeting online for 10-20 minutes of practice, followed by a reflective discussion. This format is small enough for intimate sharing yet large enough for diverse perspective-taking. Currently, Interbe.ing have nine different practices that all utilise the same group format where individuals are saying out loud their experience.

### “May Heartfulness Arise” Practice:

Among these nine Interbe.ing practices, “May Heartfulness Arise” exemplifies the power of their simple group format. Like its companion practices, it follows the standard structure: 4 participants gather online for 10-20 minutes of practice, followed by a brief group reflection. But within this structure lies a space for deep experimentation and spontaneous resonance.

The practice itself is beautifully straightforward. Each person takes their turn completing the phrase “May ______ arise.” What makes it come alive is the freedom to play within this format – to voice wishes that range from profound to playful, from personal to universal. Sometimes I find myself echoing another’s wish that particularly resonates, or building upon a theme that emerges in the group. One person might offer “May inner peace arise,” which sparks in another “May peace spread outward,” creating an organic dialogue of aspirations.

This experimental space allows us to try on different wishes, to voice what might otherwise feel too strange or too vast: a wish for universal love, for the healing of all beings, or sometimes something as simple yet profound as “May ease arise.” There’s no pressure to stick with any particular theme – we can touch a wish lightly and move on, or dive deeper when something calls for extended exploration.

What fascinates me is how the practice gradually shifts from individual noting to something larger and more interconnected. Over time, it begins to feel less like four separate people taking turns, and more like participating in a collective field of well-wishing. This subtle shift manifests in my body as a warm sensation across my back – a felt sense that “someone has my back” – accompanied by a warm heart radiating love and care. My mind settles into a peaceful state, recognizing there is no threat here, just shared presence and intention.

These effects extend beyond the formal practice sessions. I’ve noticed these phrases arising spontaneously in daily life, like recently at a pool when “May cooling water arise” emerged naturally at the sight of swimmers. 
### Different Practices of Interbe.ing:

Current to January 2025, the specific nine Interbe.ing practices are:

## Agency by Design: Interbe.ing's Trauma-Informed Framework

Interbe.ing’s trauma-informed foundation is evidenced through its explicit emphasis on participant agency and clearly articulated engagement parameters. Each session opens with the facilitator outlining a spectrum of participation options, termed ‘stances’:

- Full engagement in the practice
- Using “Thank you” to pass
- Shifting to “Witnessing” mode for observation
- Returning to active participation through sharing at any point

These straightforward options serve a deeper purpose than mere procedural guidelines – they establish a framework where agency becomes woven into the fabric of the practice itself, rather than an afterthought or exception.

This structure enables participants to modulate their engagement level in real time, a crucial element for trauma-informed practice. Van der Kolk in Body Keeps The Score emphasises that trauma integration requires ‘a brain that is alert and present’, noting that expanding one’s window of tolerance must precede deeper therapeutic work. This understanding is further supported by Polyvagal Theory’s insights into social engagement systems. The practice’s emphasis on vocalization and social engagement naturally activates the ventral vagal pathway, what Porges describes as our ‘social nervous system’. This biological framework helps explain why sharing experiences aloud can feel both challenging and regulating – it’s literally engaging our nervous system’s capacity for connection and co-regulation.

By normalizing fluid movement between different levels of participation, Interbe.ing creates conditions where individuals can safely explore the edges of their comfort zone while maintaining autonomy. This is particularly salient for those who typically freeze in communal settings – the explicit permission to adjust engagement without explanation transforms what could be a triggering group experience into an opportunity for building agency and capacity for presence.

## Public Health Scope for Interbe.ing type practices:

The potential integration of relational meditation practices like Interbe.ing into certified mindfulness programs presents an intriguing opportunity, particularly within Australia’s Medicare-supported mental health framework. Currently, Australians can access up to 10 individual sessions with a Psychologist or Mental Health Social Worker, plus 10 group therapy sessions through Medicare-certified practitioners under the Mental Health Care Plan.

While formal integration remains distant—I’m not sure about the research basis currently though I have heard murmurs they would still be in a pilot phases—I see Interbe.ing serving a complementary role similar to peer support movements. Like AA, it offers a space where individuals can develop fundamental skills, build supportive relationships, and gain insights that complement deeper interventions such as psychotherapy and trauma work. This accessibility and flexibility makes it particularly valuable as part of a broader mental health ecosystem, adaptable to diverse needs, histories, and recovery pathways.

The research potential here, particularly in measuring outcomes and establishing evidence-based protocols, warrants further investigation. Such studies could pave the way for future integration into formal mental health support structures while maintaining the practice’s essential qualities of accessibility and participant agency.

## Now, what for me?

When Interbe.ing opened up to “doing it with other people” in November 2024, I jumped right in. I’ve been showing up three times a week, and I’m finding myself wanting to make it a daily thing. The practices have landed so well for me that I’m keen to do their teacher training. There’s a real gap in the Australian/Asian timezone, and I’d love to help fill that.

What gets me excited about these practices is how they just work. Interbe.ing has created this clean, clear container for developing our inner skills, and it flows so naturally into how we show up with others. It's like they've found this sweet spot – enough structure to hold the space, but plenty of room for everyone to find their own way.

## How to check it out:

Interbe.ing is held online at the moment and accessible via with 2 sessions being held each USA timed week day. There are 8am sessions and 12:30pm sessions for the Australian time zone.   

## Looking Forward

This introduction merely scratches the surface of what I’ve discovered through my ongoing practice with Interbe.ing. In upcoming posts, I’ll explore:

- Implications for addressing the loneliness epidemic
- How this practice builds intrapersonal awareness through public articulation, expanding our window of emotional tolerance
- Its alignment with Third Wave CBT approaches like DBT and ACT
- The Buddhist framework underlying these practices
- Why gamification and fun are crucial elements for sustainable practice
- Games as “McGuffins” for deepening friendship and connection
- The journey from states to traits in meditative practice
- The power of common languages for emotions and what gets lost when their are silos of language policing and meaning making.
