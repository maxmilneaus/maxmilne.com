# Teyber and Teyber:


Although writing a case formulation is often challenging, completing one is important because it helps therapists provide more focused treatments. 
1. Formulation of the problem(s). Summarize the client’s presenting problem(s). Why is the client seeking treatment now? What organizing themes or history characterize the client’s most important experiences with others? 
2. Treatment focus. Identify the maladaptive relational patterns and beliefs that recur for the client. Thinking of the client’s IWMs, ask yourself the following questions: (1) What does the client want from others (e.g., to be cared for, to have autonomy supported)? (2) What does the client expect from others (e.g., to be criticized, ignored, abandoned)? (3) What is the client’s experience of Self in relationship to others (e.g., a sense of being unimportant, burdensome)? (4) What conflicted feelings are typical for this client (e.g., anger, anxiety, shame)? (5) What interpersonal coping strategies are characteristic for this client (e.g., to comply and go along, to withdraw and convey no need for others, to dominate and take control)? (6) What do these coping strategies tend to elicit from the therapist and others (e.g., disinterest, advice giving)? Use your responses to these questions to identify two or three primary treatment focuses that clarify what’s wrong and needs to change for this client. 
3. Developmental context. What are the familial and cultural issues that have shaped the client’s presenting problems and worldview? How did the family nurture, discipline and communicate? In other words, how did the client’s early maladaptive schemas, interpersonal coping strategies, and attachment styles develop? 
4. Therapeutic process. Describe the quality of the working alliance and how you and the client have interacted together. How are you trying to make the client’s relational experiences with you repair or disconfirm problematic experiences in other relationships? When the client is distressed, how does he or she tend to misperceive and react to you? Have you been able to address potential problems between you and work through rupture-repair episodes?
5. Goals and interventions. As you focus on the two to three core treatment issues identified in item 2, indicate how you plan to address these. Articulate as clearly as possible the specific corrective experiences that this client needs from you to meet the treatment goals identified. How are you helping this client to generalize new experiences with you to relationships outside of therapy? Consider also what referrals might be appropriate (e.g., group counseling, medication). In sum, clarify where you want to go with this client and how you plan to get there. 
6. Impediments to change. Anticipate why treatment could fail. If the client terminates prematurely or treatment is not successful, what factors might contribute? What client characteristics are most likely to impede sustaining a strong working alliance? Are there any significant personal, familial, or cultural factors that may make it difficult for this client to acknowledge having problems or to ask for help? Are you able to talk with the client about how you work together and what you could do to make treatment more helpful? Most importantly, suggest how the client’s maladaptive relational patterns with others could subtly be reenacted with you in the therapeutic relationship.
