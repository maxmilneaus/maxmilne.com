## On Making Within Constraints

My creative practice centers on working emergently within constraints—whether chosen or determined by circumstance.

Rather than starting with a fixed plan, I trust what wants to emerge when I show up consistently to the work. The constraint isn't a limitation but a frame that focuses attention, revealing what's possible within specific boundaries.

This approach comes from fifteen years as a photographer, where the frame itself—what you include and exclude—is the fundamental creative decision. Every choice narrows possibility while simultaneously opening new ways of seeing.

### In Practice

Whether I'm:
- Making photographs
- Facilitating groups
- Writing
- Creating performance work
- Working therapeutically

The underlying question remains: *What wants to emerge here, within these particular constraints, at this particular time?*

Not forcing. Not controlling. Attending.

### Working Together

I collaborate on projects at the intersection of contemplation, creativity, and care. This might look like:
- Performance and installation work
- Photography and visual storytelling
- Facilitation and workshop design
- Creative research and documentation

If you're working on something that resonates with this approach, I'd be glad to hear from you.
