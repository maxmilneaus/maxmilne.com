# Max Milne Website Design System
*A systematic approach to cozy, contemplative design*

**Last updated:** June 11, 2025  
**Design Philosophy:** Systems thinking with mathematical relationships  
**Current theme:** Viola/Rams with Factor-Based Architecture

---

## 1. Design Philosophy & Systems Thinking

### Core Principles

**Mys (Swedish):** That feeling of cozy contentment - candlelight warmth, intimate conversations, thoughtful reflection.

**Lagom (Swedish):** Just the right amount - not too much, not too little.

**Kaizen:** Continuous subtle improvements that enhance without overwhelming.

**Systems Thinking:** Every design decision creates relationships. Changes should be universal, factor-based, and mathematically consistent.

### Language Consistency

**Identity Tagline:** "Therapist, Artist, Contemplative"
- Use this exact language consistently across all pages
- Not "counsellor, meditation teacher, artist" or other variations
- Appears on: Homepage, About page, and should be referenced consistently throughout

**Rationale:**
- Creates memorable, consistent brand language
- Three parallel roles of equal weight
- Alliterative and rhythmic

### Aesthetic: "Viola/Rams + Systems"

**Viola (The Mood):** Atmospheric and contemplative, achieved through warm, dark backgrounds and clean blue accents.

**Rams (The Structure):** Functional and honest. Every element is purposeful, with clear typographic hierarchy over decoration.

**Systems (The Method):** Factor-based spacing, universal color variables, and mathematical relationships that scale consistently.

## 2. Information Architecture & Attention Economy

### Site Purpose & Identity

**Primary Purpose:** Extended CV / artist profile where Max can talk about things important to him
**Business Site:** Talk. Art. Therapy. will be the dedicated business site
**This Site:** Holistic professional presence showcasing full range of work, interests, and thinking

### Page Structure & Purpose

Each page serves a distinct purpose in the attention economy, directing visitor focus strategically.

#### Homepage - Action Gateway
**URL:** `/`
**Purpose:** What's available now
**Job:** Immediate context + clear pathways without overwhelming

**What It Shows:**
- Profile image + identity tagline ("Therapist, Artist, Contemplative")
- Three core identity statements with embedded CTAs
- Therapy offering → Talk. Art. Therapy.
- Creative approach → How Max works
- YouTube/nerdy solutions → Technical explorations

**What It Doesn't Show:**
- Latest writing (lives on Writing page)
- Topic tags (lives on Writing page filters)
- Project portfolio (lives on Projects page)
- Current explorations (lives on Now page)

**Attention Economy Decision:** Homepage is conversion-focused. No competing content sections that dilute the primary CTAs. Visitors can act immediately or navigate deeper via main nav.

#### About Page - Credibility & Philosophy
**URL:** `/about`
**Purpose:** Why trust me, what I believe
**Job:** Trust-building and philosophy for potential clients/collaborators

**Structure:**
- Lead with present work (Talk. Art. Therapy.)
- Credentials & formal training
- Stone stairs philosophy (sustained attention vs sudden transformation)
- Chronological background for those who want full context

**Attention Economy Decision:** Front-loads credibility markers and approach philosophy. Current work appears first (not buried at end of chronology). Visitors can assess fit quickly.

**Why This Order:**
- Many visitors ask: "Should I work with you?" (needs immediate answer)
- Philosophy shows HOW you think (more valuable than chronological CV)
- Background provides depth for those who want it (but doesn't gate-keep primary info)

#### Now Page - Current Explorations (Hybrid)
**URL:** `/now`
**Purpose:** What I'm thinking about + what I'm actively working on
**Job:** Hybrid status update + actionable connection points

**Structure:**
1. **Primary Work** (actionable) - Talk. Art. Therapy. + Social Meditation with CTAs
2. **Current Explorations** (informational) - AI & privacy, grief zine, personal practice

**Attention Economy Decision:** Clear visual separation between "work with me" (actionable boxes with CTAs) and "what I'm exploring" (plain paragraphs). Visitors can engage if relevant, or simply stay updated on your thinking.

**Why Hybrid Approach:**
- Respects different visitor intentions (some want to engage, some want to follow)
- Maintains authenticity (personal updates without forcing CTA onto everything)
- Provides multiple connection points without being transactional

#### Projects Page - Portfolio
**URL:** `/projects`
**Purpose:** What I've made
**Job:** Extended CV showcasing breadth of work across 15 years

**Structure:**
- Filter buttons: All • art • business • motion • performance • stills
- Talk. Art. Therapy. highlighted as "CURRENT" with visual distinction
- Chronological project list with year | title | description

**Attention Economy Decision:** Only Talk. Art. Therapy. gets "CURRENT" badge and CTA. This highlights the primary offering without making the page purely commercial. Portfolio remains a showcase of full creative range.

**Why TAT Gets Highlighted:**
- It's the current professional focus (2025 -)
- Provides booking path for interested visitors
- Doesn't diminish historical work (Studio Brunswick, VOICE, etc. remain equal weight)
- Balances "this is what I do now" with "this is what I've done"

#### Writing Page - Ideas
**URL:** `/writing`
**Purpose:** What I'm exploring in depth
**Job:** Topic-based content discovery

**Structure:**
- Topic filters: all • attention • counselling • creativity • grief • groups • etc.
- Comma-separated filter buttons with ", more →" toggle for hidden topics
- Article list with date | title grid

**Attention Economy Decision:** Topic filtering reduces decision fatigue. Visitors can narrow to their interest rather than scanning full chronological list. No excerpts on main page (keeps it scannable), but individual articles have "You might also enjoy" recommendations.

**Why Topic Filters:**
- Visitors have specific interests ("show me grief-related writing")
- Reduces cognitive load (6-8 visible topics vs overwhelming tag list)
- Algorithmic recommendations on article pages maintain engagement

#### Tag/Topic Pages - Deep Dives
**URL:** `/tags/creativity/` (etc.)
**Purpose:** Collection of all content on specific topic
**Job:** Topical content aggregation

**Structure:**
- Breadcrumb heading: "Topics / Creativity"
- Count of entries
- List of articles on this topic

**Attention Economy Decision:** Clean, focused pages for visitors who want to explore a single theme deeply. No sidebar clutter or competing navigation.

### Content Highlighting Strategy

**Where Each Content Type Lives:**

| Content Type | Primary Location | Why Not Homepage? |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Recent Writing | Writing page | Competes with CTAs, duplicates Writing page |
| Project Portfolio | Projects page | Too much info for homepage gateway |
| Current Work | Homepage CTAs + Now page | Homepage for conversion, Now for depth |
| Topic Tags | Writing page filters | Better UX as functional filters than decorative pills |
| Credentials | About page | Trust-building lives in dedicated About context |

**Visual Weight Hierarchy:**

1. **Talk. Art. Therapy.** - Primary offering, highlighted on Projects page, CTAs on Homepage + Now
2. **Social Meditation** - Secondary offering, actionable box on Now page
3. **Historical Projects** - Equal weight on Projects page (no hierarchy among past work)
4. **Writing** - Topic-filtered exploration, recommendations maintain engagement
5. **Personal Explorations** - Informational content on Now page (no CTAs)

### Attention Economy Principles Applied

**1. Separation of Concerns**
- Homepage = action gateway
- Writing page = content exploration
- About = credibility & philosophy
- Projects = portfolio breadth
- Now = current focus (hybrid)

**2. Reduce Decision Fatigue**
- Homepage: 3 clear paths, no competing sections
- Writing: Topic filters narrow choices
- Projects: Category filters + single "current" highlight
- Recommendations: 3-5 curated suggestions vs full content dump

**3. Respect Visitor Intent**
- Want to book therapy? → Homepage CTA + Now page actionable box
- Want to learn about Max? → About page with credentials + philosophy
- Want to explore ideas? → Writing page with topic filters
- Want to see past work? → Projects page portfolio
- Want current status? → Now page hybrid structure

**4. Clear Visual Hierarchy**
- Actionable content gets visual distinction (blue-tinted boxes, CTAs, underlines)
- Informational content remains plain (readable but not competing for attention)
- Current work highlighted (but not overwhelming historical work)

**5. Content Duplication Avoided**
- Don't show writing on Homepage AND Writing page (creates maintenance burden)
- Don't show topics as decorative pills on Homepage AND functional filters on Writing page
- Single source of truth for each content type

### Information Architecture Rationale

**Why This Structure Works:**

**For Potential Clients:**
- Homepage → Immediate understanding + booking path
- About → Credentials check + philosophy alignment
- Now → See current work + engagement options

**For Peers/Collaborators:**
- Projects → Full professional range
- Writing → Depth on topics of mutual interest
- Now → Current explorations + personal practice

**For Casual Visitors:**
- Homepage → Quick orientation
- Writing → Topic-based discovery
- Tag pages → Deep dive on specific interests

**Why NOT Consolidate:**
- Could fold Now into About → Loses the personal/exploratory feel, makes About too long
- Could fold Topics into Homepage → Competes with CTAs, duplicates Writing page function
- Could highlight all current projects → Dilutes TAT focus, makes Projects page commercial

**Design Philosophy:** Each page has one clear job. Visitors can navigate based on their intent (act, learn, explore, assess). No page tries to do everything.

## 3. Systems Architecture

### Factor-Based Spacing System

**Implementation:** `_sass/_style.scss` (CSS variables in `:root`)

Our spacing system uses **mathematical relationships** rather than arbitrary values:

- `--space-xs: 0.25rem` - Base unit
- `--space-sm: 0.5rem` - 2x base
- `--space-md: 1rem` - 4x base
- `--space-lg: 1.75rem` - 7x base
- `--space-xl: 3rem` - 12x base

**Mathematical relationships:**
- All spacing derives from `0.25rem` base unit
- Creates harmonic proportions: 1:2:4:7:12
- Section rhythm uses semantic variables for global consistency
- Enables systematic scaling across all elements

### Universal Spacing Rules

**Implementation:** `_sass/_style.scss:main` and `_sass/_style.scss:hr`

**Content Container Spacing:**
- `main` element: `calc(var(--space-xl) * 1.25)` top margin (3.75rem)
- Creates universal top spacing across all page types
- Bottom margin: `var(--space-xl)` (3rem)

**Horizontal Rules (HR) System:**
- Margin: `var(--section-spacing) 0` (3rem top and bottom)
- Background: `var(--color-divider)`
- Creates consistent visual rhythm for section breaks

### Section Dividers

**Implementation:** `_sass/_style.scss:.section-divider`

A dedicated class for horizontal rules used as section dividers, ensuring consistent spacing and visual rhythm between major content blocks.

**Behavior:**
- Extends `hr` styling
- `margin-top: 0` - Removes top margin to prevent double spacing
- `margin-bottom: var(--section-spacing)` - Consistent spacing after divider

**Design Principles:**
- **Visual Rhythm:** Creates clear separation between sections while maintaining consistent vertical spacing.
- **Reusability:** A single class for all section dividers, promoting consistency and ease of maintenance.
- **Systematic Spacing:** Utilizes `--section-spacing` for predictable layout.

**Systems Benefits:**
- ✅ **Universal consistency** - One rule affects all pages
- ✅ **Mathematical harmony** - 2:3 proportional relationships
- ✅ **Maintenance simplicity** - Change factors, not individual values
- ✅ **Visual rhythm** - Predictable spacing relationships

---

## 4. Color Architecture

**Implementation:** `_sass/_style.scss` (CSS variables in `:root`)

### Primary Palette with Systematic Variables

**Base Colors:**
- `--color-deep: #141210` - Background
- `--color-charcoal: #201d1a` - Secondary backgrounds
- `--color-graphite: #2d2926` - Borders, subtle elements
- `--color-stone: #4a453f` - Base divider color
- `--color-cream: #e8ddd4` - Primary text
- `--color-warm-gray: #c7beb5` - Secondary text
- `--color-meta: #9c958c` - Label text, metadata

**Interactive:**
- `--color-accent-hover: #93c5fd` - All hover states
- `--color-accent-subtle: #3b82f6` - Accent elements

**System Colors (Mathematical Relationships):**
- `--color-divider: rgba(74, 69, 63, 0.6)` - Stone + systematic 0.6 opacity

### Universal Divider System

**One variable controls ALL content dividers:**

Applied to: `hr`, `footer`, `.backlink-box`, and all section dividers throughout the site.

**Systems Benefits:**
- ✅ **Single source of truth** for divider appearance
- ✅ **Consistent visual weight** across all dividers
- ✅ **Easy theme changes** - modify one variable
- ✅ **No scattered opacity values**

---

## 5. Typography System

**Implementation:** `_sass/_style.scss` (heading and body text rules)

### Emphasis and Strong Text

**Bold/Strong Text Usage:**

Bold text (`<strong>` or `**text**` in markdown) is used for emphasis within body content, typically in lists where category labels need visual distinction.

**Design Principles:**
- Use bold sparingly - primarily for category labels in structured content
- Standard weight (600) through `<strong>` element
- Emphasizes within content flow, not creating hierarchy level
- Reserved for inline emphasis, not section headings

### Hierarchical Scale with Mathematical Relationships

**Font Sizes:**
- `h1`: 2rem (32px) - Primary heading
- `h2`: 1.65rem (26.4px) - Section heading
- `h3`: 1.35rem (21.6px) - Subsection
- `body`: 1rem (16px base), 1.05rem on screens >820px

**Line Heights:**
- Body text: 1.7 (optimized for reading)
- `h1`: 1.15 (tighter for impact)
- `h2-h6`: 1.25 (balanced for hierarchy)

### Spacing Relationships

**Factor-Based Margins:**
- `h2`, `h3`: `var(--space-xl)` top margin (3rem subsection breaks)
- `p`: `var(--space-md)` top, `var(--space-lg)` bottom (1rem - 1.75rem rhythm)

---

## 6. Component Architecture

**Implementation:** Components across `_sass/_style.scss`, `_sass/_projects.scss`, `_sass/_writing.scss`

### Refined Component System - Systematic Inheritance

**Base classes for consistent behavior:** `_sass/_style.scss`

Base `.label` class provides consistent styling for all section headers. The `.section-label` extends this pattern.

**Used on:** Projects page filter label, Writing page filter label

**Design Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for spacing and styling
- Changes to base classes affect all components systematically
- Reduces CSS duplication and maintenance overhead
- Maintains visual consistency automatically

### Homepage Structure

**Purpose:** Minimal, action-oriented gateway that provides immediate context and clear pathways without overwhelming visitors.

**Structure:**
1. **Profile Image** - 80px circular image with subtle box shadow
2. **Tagline** - "Therapist, Artist, Contemplative" in `<em>` (italic)
3. **Three Identity Paragraphs** - Each with embedded CTA links

**Design Philosophy:**

The homepage intentionally does NOT include:
- ❌ "Latest" section with recent writing
- ❌ "Topics" section with tag pills
- ❌ Preview content or article excerpts
- ❌ Section dividers or complex layouts

**Why This Minimal Approach:**

**Attention Economy Decision:** The homepage serves as an **action gateway**, not a content showcase. Visitors can:
1. Understand who you are immediately (profile + tagline + 3 paragraphs)
2. Take action based on their interest (therapy, creative approach, YouTube/nerdy explorations)
3. Navigate to deeper content via main navigation (About, Now, Projects, Writing)

**Reasoning:**
- **Reduces decision fatigue** - Three clear paths instead of competing content sections
- **Respects visitor time** - No scrolling through multiple sections to find booking links
- **Separates concerns** - Homepage = action gateway, Writing page = content exploration
- **Maintains focus** - Each paragraph has one clear purpose with embedded CTA
- **Lagom principle** - Just the right amount of information, not too little, not too much

**Where Content Lives Instead:**
- Recent writing → `/writing/` page with topic filters
- Topics exploration → Tag pages (`/tags/creativity/`, etc.)
- Portfolio showcase → `/projects/` page
- Current explorations → `/now/` page with hybrid action/info structure

**Technical Implementation:**

**Profile Image:**
```scss
.profile-image {
  width: 80px;
  height: 80px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  box-shadow: subtle shadow;
}
```

**Tagline Styling:**
- Uses `<em>` element for semantic emphasis
- Rendered in italic by default
- No special color treatment - uses body text color

**Paragraph CTAs:**
- Inline links within narrative paragraphs
- Standard link styling (underline, blue hover)
- Not button-styled - maintains reading flow

**Why NOT Latest/Topics Sections:**

The original design included "Latest" and "Topics" sections on the homepage, but these were removed because:
1. **Competing attention** - CTAs for therapy sessions vs "read this article" creates conflicting goals
2. **Content duplication** - Writing page already has full topic filtering system
3. **Scroll depth** - Important booking CTAs were pushed down by content sections
4. **Information architecture** - Clearer separation: homepage = gateway, writing page = exploration

**Future Consideration:** If homepage needs to showcase recent work, consider a single "Latest" link in the footer or navigation, not a full section that competes for attention with primary CTAs.

### Actionable Content Boxes (Now Page Pattern)

**Purpose:** Visual distinction between actionable work (with CTAs) and informational content.

**Structure:**
```html
<div style="background: rgba(147, 197, 253, 0.05); padding: 1rem; border-left: 3px solid var(--color-accent-hover); margin: 1rem 0;">
  <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Work Title</strong> — Brief description</p>
  <a href="/path" style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 1rem; padding: 0.5rem 1.75rem; background: var(--color-charcoal); color: var(--color-accent-hover); text-decoration: none; border: 1px solid var(--color-accent-subtle); border-radius: 3px; font-weight: 500; transition: all 200ms ease;">Call to Action →</a>
</div>
```

**Design Tokens:**
- **Box background:** `rgba(147, 197, 253, 0.05)` - Subtle blue tint
- **Left border:** `3px solid var(--color-accent-hover)` - Blue accent
- **Button background:** `var(--color-charcoal)`
- **Button text:** `var(--color-accent-hover)`
- **Button border:** `1px solid var(--color-accent-subtle)`
- **Padding:** Systematic `1rem` (var(--space-md))
- **Button padding:** `0.5rem 1.75rem` (var(--space-sm) and var(--space-lg))

**Usage:**
- Use for Primary Work items that require user action
- Do NOT use for informational content (Current Explorations)
- Creates clear visual hierarchy: boxed = actionable, plain = informational

**Technical Notes:**
- Currently implemented with inline styles for rapid prototyping
- Can be extracted to reusable `.actionable-box` and `.cta-button` classes
- Maintains systematic spacing and color tokens

### Section Headers - Universal Pattern

**Implementation:** `_sass/_style.scss:293-300`

```scss
.section-label {
  font-size: 1rem;
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);
  color: var(--color-meta);
  letter-spacing: 0.03em;
  margin-bottom: var(--space-md);
}
```

**Used on:** Projects page filter label, Writing page filter label

**Reasoning:** Creates consistent labeling across different page types without being clickable (uses `pointer-events: none`).

### Footer Animation and Caption Alignment

**Implementation:** `_sass/_style.scss:.stove-signature` and `_sass/_animations.scss:.goldsworthy-fragments`

The footer animation and its accompanying caption are now aligned to the left, providing a consistent visual flow with the rest of the page content.

**Key Changes:**
- `.stove-signature`: `text-align: left` aligns caption and animation container
- `.goldsworthy-fragments`: Removed `margin: 0 auto` to allow left alignment
- Animation: `natural-breath` 8s infinite cycle

**Design Principles:**
- **Consistency:** Aligns with the overall left-aligned content flow of the site.
- **Clarity:** Ensures the caption is easily readable and associated with the animation.
- **Systematic Spacing:** Continues to use `var(--space-xl)` and `var(--space-md)` for vertical rhythm.

### Article Lists - Grid System

**Implementation:** `_sass/_style.scss:ul a`

Grid layout: Date | Separator | Title with quarter-unit spacing (`0.25rem` gap), baseline-aligned for clean visual rhythm.

### Projects Components

**Implementation:** `_sass/_projects.scss`

#### Dieter Rams Color Hierarchy

The projects section follows a systematic color hierarchy inspired by Dieter Rams' design principles - functional, honest, and unobtrusive.

**Color System:**
- `.project-title a`: `var(--color-cream)` - Primary hierarchy (draws the eye)
- `.project-description`, `.project-year`, `.project-meta`: `var(--color-meta)` - Secondary hierarchy (readable but supportive)

**Design Principles:**
- **Clear Hierarchy:** Project titles stand out in cream, while supporting details recede into the warm gray metadata tone
- **Consistent System:** All secondary information shares the same color for visual coherence
- **Dieter Rams Influence:** "As little design as possible" - typography and hierarchy over decoration
- **Readability:** The `--color-meta` tone (#9c958c) maintains legibility while establishing clear information architecture

**Applied To:**
- `.project-description` - Short project summaries on listing pages
- `.project-description-inline` - Descriptions shown under project titles on detail pages
- `.project-year` - Date ranges on listing pages
- `.project-year-inline` - Dates in grid layout
- `.project-meta` - Metadata container for dates and status

#### Filter Tabs (Minimal Rams Approach)

**Implementation:** `_sass/_projects.scss:.project-filter`

The project filter tabs follow the "as little design as possible" principle with underline indicators for selection.

**Styling:**
- Background: transparent, no borders except 2px bottom border
- Default: `var(--color-meta)` gray
- Hover/Active: `var(--color-accent-hover)` muted blue with underline
- Letter-spacing: 0.02em (tight, refined)
- Transition: 200ms ease on color and border

**Filter Label:**
- Color: `var(--color-meta)` (non-interactive)
- `pointer-events: none` (cannot be clicked)
- Margin-bottom: `var(--space-md)` (1rem space to buttons)

**Design Principles:**
- **Minimal UI:** No borders or backgrounds - only text and underline indicator
- **Clear Affordance:** 2px bottom border appears on hover and selection
- **Color Differentiation:** Static "Filter" label stays meta gray, interactive buttons change to muted blue
- **Muted Palette:** Uses `--color-accent-hover` (#93c5fd) not electric blue for softer appearance
- **Systematic Spacing:** Reduced letter-spacing (0.02em) creates tighter, more refined feel
- **Rams Principle:** Pure function without decoration

**Interaction Pattern:**
- Default: Meta gray text, no underline (subtle invitation)
- Hover: Muted blue text + underline (indicates interactivity)
- Active: Muted blue text + underline (maintains consistency with hover)
- Label: Always meta gray (non-interactive, descriptive only)

### Tag System Components

**Implementation:** `_sass/_style.scss:.tag-page-title` and `.tag-meta`

#### Tag Page Navigation (Steph Ango Pattern)

**Styling:**
- `.tag-page-title`: 2rem, slimmer font weight, tag name in `var(--color-cream)`
- "Topics" link: `var(--color-meta)` gray, no underline, hovers to `var(--color-accent-hover)`
- `.tag-meta`: `var(--color-meta)`, 1rem, `var(--space-xl)` bottom margin

**Tag Design Principles:**
- **Color Hierarchy:** "Topics" (meta gray) vs tag name (cream) for clear navigation
- **Typography:** Slimmer font weight following Steph Ango patterns
- **Spacing:** Factor-based margins using systematic variables
- **Interaction:** Subtle hover states with consistent accent colors

## 6. Systems Guidelines for Future Development

### Making Systematic Design Decisions

**✅ DO: Use Factor-Based Thinking**
```scss
/* Good - uses mathematical relationship */
margin: calc(var(--space-xl) * 1.5) 0;

/* Good - derives from base spacing */
padding: var(--space-md) var(--space-lg);

/* Good - systematic tag page spacing */
.tag-page-title { margin-bottom: var(--space-sm); }
.tag-meta { margin-bottom: var(--space-xl); }
```

**❌ DON'T: Use Arbitrary Values**
```scss
/* Bad - magic number with no system relationship */
margin: 47px 0;

/* Bad - inline styles that can't be systematically updated */
style="margin-top: 2.3rem;"

/* Bad - inconsistent tag styling */
.tag-title { margin-bottom: 0.3rem; }
```

### Adding New Components

**1. Spacing:** Use existing `--space-*` variables or create factors of them
**2. Colors:** Use existing palette or add systematic variables to `:root`
**3. Typography:** Follow established hierarchy relationships
**4. Dividers:** Always use `var(--color-divider)` for consistency
**5. Navigation:** Use color hierarchy patterns (meta gray for secondary, cream for primary)
**6. Interactive Elements:** Follow hover state patterns with `var(--color-accent-hover)`

### Recommendations Component ("You might also enjoy")

**Purpose:** Intelligent content curation that reduces decision fatigue and maintains engagement.

**Implementation:**
```scss
.you-might-enjoy {
  margin: var(--space-xl) 0;
  padding: var(--space-lg) 0;
  border-top: 1px solid var(--color-divider);

  .recommendations-list {
    a {
      color: var(--color-meta);
      text-decoration: underline;

      &:hover {
        color: var(--color-accent-hover);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Tag-based similarity:** Uses shared tags to surface related content algorithmically
- **Reduces decision fatigue:** 3-5 curated suggestions > full writing list
- **Intelligent feel:** Site appears curated and thoughtful rather than dumping all content
- **Maintains engagement:** Provides clear "next reading" path without overwhelming
- **Better UX:** "Related reading" is more valuable than "see everything"

**Color Choice Rationale:**
- Uses `--color-meta` (#9c958c) for optimal visibility
- Tested progression: `--color-stone` (too dark) → `--color-warm-gray` (too bright) → `--color-meta` (balanced)
- Maintains systematic hierarchy while ensuring readability
- Hovers to `--color-accent-hover` (blue) for clear interactive state

**Technical Notes:**
- Powered by `tag_based_recommendations.rb` plugin
- Uses Jaccard similarity on shared tags
- Configurable in `_config.yml` with `max_recommendations` and `similarity_threshold`
- Replaces previous approach of showing full writing list (removed "More Writing" footer)
- Backlinks/"Linked mentions" section removed to focus on algorithmic curation

### Scaling the System

**Factor Adjustments:**
```scss
/* To increase all HR spacing proportionally: */
hr { margin: calc(var(--space-xl) * 1.2) 0 calc(var(--space-xl) * 1.8) 0; }
/* Maintains 2:3 ratio while scaling up */
```

**Color System Extensions:**
```scss
/* Add new systematic colors following the pattern: */
--color-success: rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.8);   /* Green with systematic opacity */
--color-warning: rgba(251, 191, 36, 0.8);  /* Yellow with systematic opacity */
```

---

## 7. Link System

**Implementation:** `_sass/_style.scss:a` and external link rules

### Universal Link Behavior

**All links share consistent styling:**
- Default color: `var(--color-stone)` (subtle)
- Underline with matching color
- `text-underline-offset: 0.2em` (systematic offset)
- Hover: `var(--color-accent-hover)` (blue) with matching underline
- Transition: 200ms ease on color and underline

**External Link Differentiation:**
- ↗ arrow indicator with `--color-warm-gray`
- Italic styling to distinguish from internal links
- No underline on arrow icon

---

## 8. Implementation Patterns

### Universal Rules Over Specific Overrides

**✅ Systematic Approach:**
```scss
/* One rule affects all content containers */
main { margin: calc(var(--space-xl) * 1.25) 0 var(--space-xl) 0; }
```

**❌ Individual Overrides:**
```html
<!-- Avoid scattered inline styles -->
<article style="margin-top: 3.75rem;">
<div style="margin-top: 60px;">
```

### CSS Custom Properties for Systematic Control

**✅ Variables for Mathematical Relationships:**
```scss
:root {
  --section-spacing-factor: 1.25;           /* Factor for section spacing */
  --divider-opacity: 0.6;                   /* Systematic divider opacity */
}

.latest-section {
  margin-top: calc(var(--space-xl) * var(--section-spacing-factor));
}
```

---

## 9. Responsive Behavior

### Systematic Breakpoints

```scss
/* Mobile-first with systematic scaling */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body { padding: var(--space-lg) 4vw; }     /* Scales down systematically */
}

@media (min-width: 820px) {
  body { 
    font-size: 1.05rem;                     /* 5% increase */
    line-height: 1.75;                      /* Proportional line-height */
  }
}
```

---

## 10. Quality Assurance Checklist

### Before Making Changes

- [ ] Does this use existing spacing variables or create systematic factors?
- [ ] Are colors drawn from the established palette?
- [ ] Do spacing relationships maintain mathematical harmony?
- [ ] Can this change be made universally rather than specifically?
- [ ] Does this improve the system or just solve an isolated problem?

### After Implementation

- [ ] Do all similar elements now behave consistently?

This design system creates **mathematical harmony** through factor-based relationships while maintaining the cozy, contemplative aesthetic. Every spacing decision derives from systematic thinking rather than visual approximation.

**Key Philosophy:** *Changes should improve the entire system, not just individual components.*

### Tag System Integration

The tag system demonstrates systematic design principles:

**Automated Generation:** Jekyll plugin creates consistent page structure
**Color Hierarchy:** Breadcrumb navigation uses differential colors for clarity
**Typography Scale:** Follows established font weight and size relationships
**Spacing Rhythm:** All margins use systematic `--space-*` variables
**Interaction Patterns:** Hover states follow established accent color system

**Technical Implementation:**
- Template-driven tag pages ensure visual consistency
- Manual tag collection handles Jekyll collection limitations
- Smart pluralization maintains professional content presentation
- Clean URL structure follows SEO best practices

## 11. Animation Palette & Presentation

Purpose: Establish consistent, quiet presentations for animated ASCII pieces that harmonize with the site’s warm, dark aesthetic.

Reference
- Canonical examples and approved palettes live in `docs/animations/ascii-petals-style-guide.html`.

Approved Variants (Pairs)
- Plain — Cream: no frame or paper; bright cream/white glyphs on the site background.
- Noir — Framed Cream: deep charcoal “paper” with a 1px border; cream/white glyphs.
- Plain — Blue: no frame or paper; blue glyphs.
- Indigo — Framed Blue: indigo “paper” with a 1px border; blue glyphs.

System Rules
- No shadows or vignettes: framed variants use only background color + 1px border to match the site’s quiet aesthetic.
- Colors via CSS variables on the wrapper:
  - `--paper`: canvas background (use `transparent` for Plain variants)
  - `--accent`, `--accent2`: glyph color stops for the pulsing blend
- Accessibility: animations honor `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` (render a static frame).

Color Tokens
- Cream pair: `--accent: #ffffff`, `--accent2: #e8ddd4`
- Blue pair: `--accent: #3b82f6`, `--accent2: #93c5fd`
- Papers: `#151311` (Noir), `#0f1218` (Indigo), or `transparent` (Plain variants)

Usage Pattern
Wrap the canvas in a container that defines the palette via CSS variables. The renderer reads colors from the closest wrapper.

```html
<section class="ascii ascii-noir-cream"
  style="--paper:#151311; --accent:#ffffff; --accent2:#e8ddd4; border:1px solid var(--color-graphite); background: var(--color-charcoal);">
  <canvas width="920" height="920"></canvas>
  <!-- animation script reads --paper/--accent/--accent2 from this wrapper -->
  <!-- no shadows; only simple background + 1px border for framed variants -->
  <!-- use transparent paper for Plain variants -->
</section>
```

Future Extraction
- Extract these into `_sass/_ascii.scss` as reusable classes (e.g., `.ascii-plain-cream`, `.ascii-noir-cream`, `.ascii-plain-blue`, `.ascii-indigo-blue`) to standardize usage across pages.
