# Leap of Insight — Visual Options

A bevy of minimal, tactile visuals inspired by your poem: MUJI simplicity, bamboo bending, Jimmy’s woven characters, a weighted door handle’s click, a brick net cast into the unknown, and the practice of listening as things change over ages.

> I am like a MUJI store. Freshly steamed. Cleaned. Simple. Yet functionally beautiful.
> I enjoy wrapping words. Bending them. As bamboo in the wind.
> My grandpa. Jimmy. Woven such characters too.
> The edge where practical and beauty meet. A well weighted door handle. That clicks.
> Like a brick. I cast my net. Into the unknown wet.
> I wish to listen to how it changes. Over the ages.

## Palette & Motion
- Base: `--color-deep` (background), `--color-stone` (structure), `--color-accent-hover` (living spark)
- Motion: slow, breath-like rhythms; occasional decisive “click” moments; respond to hover/focus; respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Tao 42 Thread (optional caption)
“Source gives birth to One; One to Two; Two to Three; Three to the ten-thousand things… When masculine and feminine come together, harmony is achieved.” Use as a soft caption or aria-label to imbue pieces with meaning without clutter.

## How to Pick
- Need ultra-minimal: MUJI Grid or Weighted Handle

- Prefer conceptual systems: Brick Net, Listening Constellation, or ASCII Petals

If you want, I can adapt any option into a small React component or inline include for Jekyll pages.
