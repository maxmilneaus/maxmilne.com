# Website Vision & Strategy

**Purpose:** Strategic intent and design philosophy for Max Milne's personal website

**Last updated:** 2025-11-07

---

## Site Purpose & Identity

**Primary Purpose:** Extended CV / artist profile where Max can talk about things important to him

**Business Site:** Talk. Art. Therapy. will be the dedicated business site (separate from this)

**This Site:** Holistic professional presence showcasing full range of work, interests, and thinking across therapy, art, and contemplative practice

---

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Mys (Swedish):** That feeling of cozy contentment - candlelight warmth, intimate conversations, thoughtful reflection.

**Why it matters:** The website should feel welcoming and contemplative, not clinical or transactional. Visitors should feel comfortable exploring at their own pace.

**Lagom (Swedish):** Just the right amount - not too much, not too little.

**Why it matters:** Every element serves a purpose. No overwhelming visitors with competing content. No sparse pages that feel unfinished. The Goldilocks principle applied to information architecture.

**Kaizen:** Continuous subtle improvements that enhance without overwhelming.

**Why it matters:** The site evolves incrementally based on how people actually use it, not through major redesigns that disrupt familiarity.

**Systems Thinking:** Every design decision creates relationships. Changes should be universal, factor-based, and mathematically consistent.

**Why it matters:** A single change (like adjusting spacing) should ripple through the entire site systematically. No arbitrary values that break visual harmony.

### Aesthetic: "Viola/Rams + Systems"

**Viola (The Mood):** Atmospheric and contemplative, achieved through warm, dark backgrounds and clean blue accents.

**Rams (The Structure):** Functional and honest. Every element is purposeful, with clear typographic hierarchy over decoration.

**Systems (The Method):** Factor-based spacing, universal color variables, and mathematical relationships that scale consistently.

**Together:** Creates a cozy, thoughtful space that feels both intimate and professional.

### Language Consistency

**Identity Tagline:** "Therapist, Artist, Contemplative"

**Rationale:**
- Creates memorable, consistent brand language
- Three parallel roles of equal weight
- Alliterative and rhythmic
- Use this exact phrasing across all pages (not "counsellor, meditation teacher, artist" or variations)

## Information Architecture & Attention Economy

### Page Structure & Purpose

Each page serves a distinct purpose in the attention economy, directing visitor focus strategically.

#### Homepage - Action Gateway
**URL:** `/`

**Purpose:** What's available now

**Job:** Immediate context + clear pathways without overwhelming

**What It Shows:**
- Profile image + identity tagline ("Therapist, Artist, Contemplative")
- Three core identity statements with embedded CTAs:
  - Therapy offering → Talk. Art. Therapy.
  - Creative approach → How Max works
  - YouTube/nerdy solutions → Technical explorations

**What It Doesn't Show:**
- Latest writing (lives on Writing page)
- Topic tags (lives on Writing page filters)
- Project portfolio (lives on Projects page)
- Current explorations (lives on Now page)

**Attention Economy Decision:** Homepage is conversion-focused. No competing content sections that dilute the primary CTAs. Visitors can act immediately or navigate deeper via main navigation.

**For visitors:** Quick orientation → clear next steps

---

#### About Page - Credibility & Philosophy
**URL:** `/about`

**Purpose:** Why trust me, what I believe

**Job:** Trust-building and philosophy for potential clients/collaborators

**Structure:**
- Lead with present work (Talk. Art. Therapy.)
- Credentials & formal training
- Stone stairs philosophy (sustained attention vs sudden transformation)
- Chronological background for those who want full context

**Attention Economy Decision:** Front-loads credibility markers and approach philosophy. Current work appears first (not buried at end of chronology). Visitors can assess fit quickly.

**Why This Order:**
- Many visitors ask: "Should I work with you?" (needs immediate answer)
- Philosophy shows HOW you think (more valuable than chronological CV)
- Background provides depth for those who want it (doesn't gate-keep primary info)

**For visitors:** Credibility check → philosophy alignment → full background

---

#### Now Page - Current Explorations (Hybrid)
**URL:** `/now`

**Purpose:** What I'm thinking about + what I'm actively working on

**Job:** Hybrid status update + actionable connection points

**Structure:**
1. **Primary Work** (actionable) - Talk. Art. Therapy. + Social Meditation with CTAs
2. **Current Explorations** (informational) - AI & privacy, grief zine, personal practice

**Attention Economy Decision:** Clear visual separation between "work with me" (actionable boxes with CTAs) and "what I'm exploring" (plain paragraphs). Visitors can engage if relevant, or simply stay updated on your thinking.

**Why Hybrid Approach:**
- Respects different visitor intentions (some want to engage, some want to follow)
- Maintains authenticity (personal updates without forcing CTA onto everything)
- Provides multiple connection points without being transactional

**For visitors:** Current work options + insight into explorations

---

#### Projects Page - Portfolio
**URL:** `/projects`

**Purpose:** What I've made

**Job:** Extended CV showcasing breadth of work across 15 years

**Structure:**
- Filter buttons: All • art • business • motion • performance • stills
- Talk. Art. Therapy. highlighted as "CURRENT" with visual distinction
- Chronological project list with year | title | description

**Attention Economy Decision:** Only Talk. Art. Therapy. gets "CURRENT" badge and CTA. This highlights the primary offering without making the page purely commercial. Portfolio remains a showcase of full creative range.

**Why TAT Gets Highlighted:**
- It's the current professional focus (2025 -)
- Provides booking path for interested visitors
- Doesn't diminish historical work (Studio Brunswick, VOICE, etc. remain equal weight)
- Balances "this is what I do now" with "this is what I've done"

**For visitors:** Professional range + current focus + clear CTA

---

#### Writing Page - Ideas
**URL:** `/writing`

**Purpose:** What I'm exploring in depth

**Job:** Topic-based content discovery

**Structure:**
- Topic filters: all • attention • counselling • creativity • grief • groups • etc.
- Comma-separated filter buttons with ", more →" toggle for hidden topics
- Article list with date | title grid

**Attention Economy Decision:** Topic filtering reduces decision fatigue. Visitors can narrow to their interest rather than scanning full chronological list. No excerpts on main page (keeps it scannable), but individual articles have "You might also enjoy" recommendations.

**Why Topic Filters:**
- Visitors have specific interests ("show me grief-related writing")
- Reduces cognitive load (6-8 visible topics vs overwhelming tag list)
- Algorithmic recommendations on article pages maintain engagement

**For visitors:** Interest-based discovery → focused reading → related suggestions

---

#### Tag/Topic Pages - Deep Dives
**URL:** `/tags/[topic]/` (e.g., `/tags/creativity/`)

**Purpose:** Collection of all content on specific topic

**Job:** Topical content aggregation

**Structure:**
- Breadcrumb heading: "Topics / Creativity"
- Count of entries
- List of articles on this topic

**Attention Economy Decision:** Clean, focused pages for visitors who want to explore a single theme deeply. No sidebar clutter or competing navigation.

**For visitors:** Comprehensive view of one topic

## Content Highlighting Strategy

### Where Each Content Type Lives

| Content Type | Primary Location | Why Not Homepage? |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Recent Writing | Writing page | Competes with CTAs, duplicates Writing page |
| Project Portfolio | Projects page | Too much info for homepage gateway |
| Current Work | Homepage CTAs + Now page | Homepage for conversion, Now for depth |
| Topic Tags | Writing page filters | Better UX as functional filters than decorative pills |
| Credentials | About page | Trust-building lives in dedicated About context |

### Visual Weight Hierarchy

1. **Talk. Art. Therapy.** - Primary offering, highlighted on Projects page, CTAs on Homepage + Now
2. **Social Meditation** - Secondary offering, actionable box on Now page
3. **Historical Projects** - Equal weight on Projects page (no hierarchy among past work)
4. **Writing** - Topic-filtered exploration, recommendations maintain engagement
5. **Personal Explorations** - Informational content on Now page (no CTAs)

---

## Attention Economy Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Homepage = action gateway
- Writing page = content exploration
- About = credibility & philosophy
- Projects = portfolio breadth
- Now = current focus (hybrid)

### 2. Reduce Decision Fatigue
- Homepage: 3 clear paths, no competing sections
- Writing: Topic filters narrow choices
- Projects: Category filters + single "current" highlight
- Recommendations: 3-5 curated suggestions vs full content dump

### 3. Respect Visitor Intent
- Want to book therapy? → Homepage CTA + Now page actionable box
- Want to learn about Max? → About page with credentials + philosophy
- Want to explore ideas? → Writing page with topic filters
- Want to see past work? → Projects page portfolio
- Want current status? → Now page hybrid structure

### 4. Clear Visual Hierarchy
- Actionable content gets visual distinction (blue-tinted boxes, CTAs, underlines)
- Informational content remains plain (readable but not competing for attention)
- Current work highlighted (but not overwhelming historical work)

### 5. Content Duplication Avoided
- Don't show writing on Homepage AND Writing page (creates maintenance burden)
- Don't show topics as decorative pills on Homepage AND functional filters on Writing page
- Single source of truth for each content type

## User Journeys

### For Potential Clients
1. Homepage → Immediate understanding + booking path
2. About → Credentials check + philosophy alignment
3. Now → See current work + engagement options

### For Peers/Collaborators
1. Projects → Full professional range
2. Writing → Depth on topics of mutual interest
3. Now → Current explorations + personal practice

### For Casual Visitors
1. Homepage → Quick orientation
2. Writing → Topic-based discovery
3. Tag pages → Deep dive on specific interests

---

## Why This Structure Works

### Each Page Has One Clear Job
- **Homepage:** Get oriented, take action
- **About:** Build trust, understand philosophy
- **Now:** See current work, optional engagement
- **Projects:** View portfolio breadth
- **Writing:** Discover ideas by topic

### No Page Tries to Do Everything
- Could fold Now into About → Loses personal/exploratory feel, makes About too long
- Could fold Topics into Homepage → Competes with CTAs, duplicates Writing page function
- Could highlight all current projects → Dilutes TAT focus, makes Projects page commercial

### Design Philosophy: Lagom
Each page has exactly what it needs - not too much, not too little. Visitors navigate based on their intent.

---

## Future Directions

### Possible Additions
- Single "Latest" link in navigation if showcasing recent work becomes important
- Grief zine integration when ready
- AI privacy tools showcase as they develop

### What to Avoid
- Latest section on homepage (competes with conversion CTAs)
- Topics decorative pills (functional filters work better)
- Multiple highlighted projects (dilutes primary focus)

### Evolution Principles
- Changes should serve visitor needs, not just "fill space"
- Test with real usage patterns before major shifts
- Maintain separation of concerns across pages
- Keep Lagom principle - right amount, not more
