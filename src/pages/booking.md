# Book a Session

## Talk. Art. Therapy.

Individual counselling sessions combining conversation, art-making, and mindfulness practice.

### What to Expect

Sessions run for 50 minutes and take place weekly or fortnightly, depending on what works for you.

We work with whatever you bring - grief, life transitions, creative blocks, questions of meaning, or simply the need for space to think aloud with someone who's paying attention.

### Approach

The work happens through conversation, sometimes with art materials available if that helps, and drawing on mindfulness practices when useful. Not every session uses all three - we follow what's needed.

I'm not here with answers. I'm a witness and companion to the process - offering tools, holding steady while you choose the stitch.

### Practical Details

**Location:** Brunswick, Melbourne
**Fee:** $150 per session
**Duration:** 50 minutes
**Frequency:** Weekly or fortnightly

### Getting Started

**Initial Consultation** - We start with a 15-minute phone conversation to see if we're a good fit. No charge.

To arrange an initial consultation, email:
[hello@maxmilne.com](mailto:hello@maxmilne.com?subject=Initial%20Consultation%20Request)

**What Happens Next:**
1. I'll respond within 48 hours to arrange a phone call
2. We have a brief conversation about what you're looking for
3. If it feels like a fit, we schedule the first session
4. If not, I can suggest other practitioners who might be better suited

### About Me

I hold a Master of Counselling from Swinburne University, with training in art therapy and mindfulness teaching. I've spent twelve months in residential meditation practice across Buddhist monasteries in Thailand, India, and Australia.

Before counselling, I worked for fifteen years as a photographer, helping people tell visual stories. I learned to notice what lives in the frame and what breathes just outside it.
