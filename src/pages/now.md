## Current Explorations

**[AI & Privacy in Therapeutic Work](/ai-and-privacy-in-therapeutic-work)** — Deep in the technical weeds of large language models, thinking about how to build secure, on-device AI systems for psychologists. Learning to code as I go, experimenting with Claude Code and local LLMs.

**[Grief Resources](/making-resources-for-grief)** — Building a grief zine with prompts for writing to the lost one, planting seeds in their memory. Tangible tools people can hold and work with.

**[Personal Practice](/on-intentional-consumption)** — Dancing regularly (Contact Improvisation, 5Rhythms). Listening to my old MP3 library album by album—more intentional than streaming's endless scroll.
