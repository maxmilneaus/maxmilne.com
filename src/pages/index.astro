    <p><em>Therapist, Artist, Contemplative</em></p>

    <p>
      I offer therapy at <a class="internal-link" href="/talk-art-therapy/">Talk. Art. Therapy.</a> through conversation, art, and mindfulness practice—helping people navigate life transitions, grief, and self-discovery.

    <p>
      My work as an Artist, visual and performance, lives at the intersection of contemplation, creativity, and care. Interested in collaborating creatively?

      In my downtime, I create videos for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@maxmilne-aus/videos">Little Nerdy Solutions</a> — where I find fixes to oddly specific problems that I have encountered, that the world of the internet has yet to solve.
