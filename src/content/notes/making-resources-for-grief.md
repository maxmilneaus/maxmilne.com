## The Grief Zine

I'm building a small zine for clients working with grief. Not a clinical manual or a self-help book. More like a collection of prompts and practices - tangible tools people can hold and work with.

## What's Inside

**Writing Prompts:**
- Letters to the lost one
- Unsaid things that want to be spoken
- Small memories worth preserving
- Questions you still have

**Ritual Actions:**
- Planting seeds in their memory
- Creating small altars or memory spaces
- Seasonal marking practices
- Physical objects as containers for grief

**Practices:**
- How to sit with what arises
- Making space for both grief and life
- Small daily rituals that honor loss

## The Format

Physical, printed. Something you can hold. Pages you can write on.

In therapeutic work, there's something about tangible objects - a printed worksheet, a stone you carry, a written letter - that helps externalize what's happening inside. Digital is useful, but sometimes grief needs weight you can feel in your hands.

## Why Make This

People often arrive at grief work with nothing. No map. No permission. No sense of what's "normal" or what practices might help.

This isn't meant to replace therapy or the hard work of grieving. It's meant to be a companion - something that says "here are some things you might try, when you're ready."

## Current Status

First draft in progress. Testing prompts with a few clients to see what lands and what doesn't. Refining based on what actually helps versus what sounds good on paper.

Planning to make it freely available - downloadable PDF and physical copies for clients who want them.

More details as it takes shape.
