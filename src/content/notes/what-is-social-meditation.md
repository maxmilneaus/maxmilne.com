## What Is Social Meditation?

Social Meditation is a relational practice where people meditate together while speaking their experience aloud.

Instead of sitting in silence, practitioners take turns voicing what they notice - sensations, thoughts, emotions - as they arise. The practice happens in small groups, creating a space between solo meditation and group therapy.

## How It Works

**The Format:**
- Small groups (typically 3-5 people)
- 10-20 minute practice sessions
- Each person speaks their experience as it arises
- No cross-talk or responding to others
- Brief group reflection afterward

**What You Might Say:**
- "Noticing tightness in my chest"
- "Thought about my to-do list"
- "Feeling anxious"
- "Warmth in my hands"
- "Mind wandering"

The practice builds awareness through the social engagement system. Speaking your experience aloud activates a different quality of attention than silent noting.

## What I'm Offering

I host free online Social Meditation sessions four mornings a week:

**Schedule:**
Monday - Thursday
6:30am AEST

**Platform:** Online via Zoom
**Cost:** Free
**Drop-in:** No registration required

Sessions run through Social Meditation Collective, evolved from what was previously called Interbe.ing. We've been meeting for about ten months now.

## Who It's For

This practice suits people who:
- Find silent meditation isolating or difficult to sustain
- Want to build contemplative skills in relationship
- Appreciate structure and accountability
- Are curious about relational approaches to mindfulness

No experience required. The format itself guides the practice.

## My Interest

I came to this practice after years of traditional silent meditation in Buddhist monasteries. What drew me was how it addresses a gap - building inner awareness while staying in connection with others.

The practice works at the intersection of contemplative tradition and contemporary understanding of how nervous systems regulate through social connection.

I'm also exploring how to bring these practices in-person, with a focus on building skills through relational practice rather than achieving particular states.
