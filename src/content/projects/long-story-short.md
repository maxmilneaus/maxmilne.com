As the duo [Transmit Recieve](https://transmitreceive.tumblr.com) sound designer [Adam Hunt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-hunt/) and I were selected to present a piece of work from our performance art work, <a class="internal-link" href="/projects/voice/">VOICE</a>, on the nascent ABC podcast – Long Story Short – Australia’s version of “This American Life”.

The piece was a trimmed 5 minute narrative driven component of the work that was performed in one take by the delightful [Penny Harpham.](https://pennyharpham.wordpress.com/)
Where she recounts a visceral retelling on a time she found someone in a crashed car alongside a highway road in country Australia. It is incredible piece that Adam so skilfully edited and crafted sound wise.
